    "faq1q": "Is STOCKHOLM! project just a branch of PRAHO! project?",
    "faq1a": "No — they are two separate nonprofits operating independently but sharing common values, origins, and collaborative projects.",
    "faq2q": "Why Stockholm specifically?",
    "faq2a": "The original concept emerged there during Annamarie's residency. Her permanent relocation made expanding operations in Stockholm a natural progression.",
    "faq3q": "What joint projects exist?",
    "faq3a": "The organizations launched with a significant EU Erasmus+ grant connecting Prague and Stockholm through participatory art, with additional international collaborations in development.",
    "faq4q": "How do the organizations differ?",
    "faq4a": "Each maintains separate teams, accounting, and funding. They function as sister organizations rather than hierarchical entities. A Memorandum of Understanding documents their relationship.",
    "faq5q": "Can people participate in both?",
    "faq5a": "Yes — involvement depends on geographic location, though many activities operate online, including project collaboration and mentoring opportunities."
